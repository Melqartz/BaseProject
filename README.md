# Base Project

## Overview
This project is a well-structured ASP.NET Core application that follows best practices in software architecture, authentication, and logging. It is designed with a multitier structure and implements key patterns such as the Repository and Services pattern, Unit of Work, and custom entity mapping.

## Features
- **Error and Trace Logging:** Comprehensive logging system for debugging and monitoring.
- **Default and Admin Areas:** Separation of concerns with different user areas.
- **Authentication Logic:** Secure authentication system for user management.
- **Multitier Architecture:** A clean separation of concerns with different application layers.
- **Repository and Services Pattern:** Implements repository and service layers for data access and business logic.
- **Unit of Work:** Ensures consistency in database transactions.
- **Entity Framework:** ORM for efficient database interaction.
- **Exception Handling Middleware:** Centralized error handling.
- **Resources Management:** Organized resource files for localization and configurations.
- **Custom Entity Mapper:** Custom mapping logic for converting between entities and DTOs.

## Technologies Used
- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- JWT Authentication
- Serilog/NLog (for logging)
- AutoMapper (for custom entity mapping)
